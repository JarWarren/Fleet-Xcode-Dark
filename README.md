# Fleet-Xcode-Dark
Xcode Dark theme for JetBrains Fleet

![Preview](preview.png)

## Installation
Add `xcode-dark.json` to the corresponding [Fleet theme directory](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/fleet/color-themes.html#location).

## Note
Xcode and Fleet treat certain tokens differently, meaning it's impossible to create a perfect copy of the original theme.

Please feel free to make suggestions or contributions. The goal is for this repository to become as close an approximation as possible.
